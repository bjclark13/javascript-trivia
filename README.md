Question format:

```
  {
    question: "Who is Batman",
    answers: [
       {
          text: "Bruce Wayne",
          isCorrect: true
       },
       {
          text: "BJ Clark",
          isCorrect: false
       }
    ]
  }
```

## Group 1

- Create a function `getRandomQuestion();` that returns a random question

- Create a function `convertIndexToLetter()` that converts an index in the alphabetic to it's letter.

- Create a function `getAnswerOptions();` that takes in a question, and returns a string with the answer 


## Group 2

- Create a function `convertLetterToIndex()` that converts a letter to it's index in the alphabet.

- Create a function `getCorrectAnswer();` that given a question, returns which answer has isCorrect = true

- Create a function countCorrectAnswers(); that looks at an array of the format

```
   [true, false, true, false]
```

and using alert() to display how many times we hit `true`

## Together

- Combine everyone's code!

- Go through the answers.

- Add the ability to filter by a `category` key in the question object.

 What are some ideas for future improvement? What is one thing we learned?
